A red and green and purple triangle, all sitting above a long thin rectangle. Below all those things is a big black circle. And an orange circle in the bottom left corner please. Oh and add a random shape somewhere on the screen suprise me.



A tan colored rectangle takes up the whole bottom half of the screen, like earth. A blue rectangle is in the upper half like sky. Put a yellow circle somewhere like the sun.
